    <h1 class="chess_title">A lot of my life i never got back</h1>
    <p class="chess_code">my biggest mistake was making a chess game that i never actually used i thought it would be easy it would send a prompt and any legal move would be played i made the huge mistake of forgeting how many possible moves there are in chess so i spent about three weeks on it got annoyed at how many things i had to write so i made a very specific move combo of moves against an opponent so i quit i just deleted it three weeks of my life i never got back so i spent # weeks recreating it here with what legal moves you could make</p>
